Project Description: GreateKart
GreateKart is a shopping platform I built purely for practice, with the goal of strengthening my understanding of Django. The project is not intended for commercial use; instead, it serves as a hands-on learning environment where I explored several important aspects of web development:
- Payment Gateway Integration – Implemented to understand how online transactions can be handled securely within a Django application.
- Image Management – Experimented with adding and displaying different product images to learn how Django handles media files.
- User Requests and Interactions – Practiced building features that allow users to send requests, interact with products, and experience a basic e-commerce workflow.
This project showcases my Django skills by combining multiple real-world features into a single platform. It reflects my ability to design, implement, and integrate essential components of a modern web application while focusing on clarity, functionality, and user experience.
